This project is to learn new tech stacks especially fastify & mongoose, which I never used before. I am familiar with MVC using django. I also familiar with sql and REST, this is my first time using node.js as backend, graphql and mongodb.

project currently not yet complete and if you see any error or code mistakes, please do tell me by creating new branch and use comment so I can learn.
